Automation scripts for DazToHue

For it to work properly, you should copy the DthUtils directory to the same directory as the DazToHue directory for Daz.

There are 2 separate scripts that you can run from Daz3d.

- G9_Body_Parser.dsa
It processes your character step by step according to the Daz to Hue with genitalia (Dicktator / Golden Palace) documentation and makes it ready for export.

1-) After the script runs, the animation keys must be converted to Lienar manually.

2-) The penis length process for Dicktator must be done manually.

- G9_Character_Seperator.dsa

This script allows the body, hair and clothes of a completed character to be recorded as separate scenes. Its main purpose is to allow the creation of more efficient characters by recording the characters and clothes in different resolutions. It will probably be obsolote.

Note: This is a rewrite, we have not yet reached the stability of the first version.
